## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r raw}
summary(raw)
```
```{r cv}
plot(silhouette)
```





```{r clu}
plot(clu)
```

## Including Plots  You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r c}
for (i in 1:6)
{
  itemFrequencyPlot(c[[i]], population = transactions, support = 0.2)
}
```


```{r c}
for (i in 1:6)
{
  plot(head(sort(freqItemsByCluster[[i]] , by="lift"), 5),method="graph",control=list(cex=.7))
}
```


```{r c}
for (i in 1:6)
{
  plot(head(sort(rulesByCluster[[i]] , by="chiSquared"), 5),method="graph", control=list(cex=.7))
}
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
